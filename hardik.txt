I'm <small>Hardik Singh</small>
Your average geek who likes coffee, gaming and $uicideboy$. I pride myself on being able to restart any router, set up a counter strike server through only my google drive and going on exactly 1 hike that I now always talk about. I also love hardware and taking apart stuff that usually doesn't fit back together. Like my old laptop, which is now only a 500Gb HDD plugged into the PC I built to play Minesweeper without lag. I also like fiddling around with custom Android roms on xda-developers and distro hopping much more often than healthy. Oh, and I also installed arch linux once.
